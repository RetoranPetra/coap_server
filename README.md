# COAP communications on the nRF52833 DK
This repository contains the code for our shared 4th year university project, to implement wireless distributed control on the nRF52833 DK.  
The client branch is the branch that most nodes are based on, with other branches containing control code, code for measuring network properties such as RTT, inteference generation and branches created by individual team member's as their working versions.  
Other members of the team haven't worked on a git repository before, so the branch structure is somewhat messy and some commit names aren't descriptive.
